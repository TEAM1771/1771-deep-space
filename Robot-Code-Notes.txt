Code Shit:
==Drive Base==
 - Four Talons . two per side
 - Two encoders . one per side
 - Automatic shifting for ball shifters

==Jacks==
 - 3 jacks
 - 3 encoders . one per jack
 - 3 talons . one per jack and one to drive once back jack is down
 - 3 limit switches . one per jack for zeroing => adaptable in case limit switches fall off
 - Starts not held, code should pull them slightly up till limit switch htis
 - Add test mode for holding jack
 - "Jack Mode. Enagage Jacking"
 - Need to worry about speed differences in Drive once on the platform and jack wheels . possibly use current draw to see if there's a load on jack wheels. This needs a lot of thought, good luck lol
- Proximity sensor facing down to see height . ultrasonic or laser
- Prevent driver fuck ups once jacks are down if higher than a foot
- Possible cool thing: if driver is holding forward, acceleration for rear jack won't break traction <- may or may not be necessary
- Try to automate

==Elevator==
 - 1 talon
 - 1 encoder
 - will start in lowest possible position
 - PID required for elevator lest we destroy the entire elevator
 - Properly tune PID
 - 6 set points for elevator: MAKE EASY TO ADD => 1 for each hatch height and port height
 - Look into PID differences for up and down elevator due to gravity

==Cragge==
 - 2 talons
 - 2 enc . one per motor
 - encoders CANNOT differ under any circumstance EVER
 - try to do PID
 - 2/3 set points => 1 straight forward, 1 ball shoot forward, (1 tilted)

==Intake==
 - Demogorgon is double-acting solenoid
 - Demogorgon default closed
 - 1 talon for intake roller
